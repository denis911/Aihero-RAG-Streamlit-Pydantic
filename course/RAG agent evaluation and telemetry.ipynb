      "2. **Update WSL2**: If you encounter the error \"WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x800701bc\", make sure to update the WSL2 Linux Kernel by following guidelines provided at this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5393).\n",

      "### Common Troubleshooting:\n",
      "- **Elevated Privileges**: If you run into an error about needing elevated privileges, make sure you are running the Docker client with administrative permissions.\n",
      "- **Initial Setup**: Make sure you have the latest version of Docker installed. If Docker seems stuck or does not start, uninstalling and reinstalling might help.\n",

      "To use Docker on Linux, you may need to follow these general steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Installation**: Depending on your Linux distribution, you can install Docker using different methods. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the snap command:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   sudo snap install docker\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This command installs Docker via snap packages, which might be available on certain versions of Ubuntu. [Learn more here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/036_1b727dde32_docker-docker-not-installable-on-ubuntu.md).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Extra Hosts Configuration**: If you're using Docker Compose and face issues resolving `host.docker.internal`, you might need to configure it in your `docker-compose.yml` file like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```yaml\n",
      "   kestra:\n",
      "     image: kestra/kestra:latest\n",
      "     extra_hosts:\n",
      "       - \"host.docker.internal:host-gateway\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This setup allows your container to access host services correctly. You can check more details on this configuration. [Read more here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-2/015_48b99a69ff_fix-add-extra_hosts-for-hostdockerinternal-on-linu.md).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Using Docker Commands**: After installing Docker, you can start using Docker commands in the terminal. Common commands include:\n",
      "   - `docker run`: To run a container.\n",
      "   - `docker ps`: To list running containers.\n",
      "   - `docker images`: To list available images.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Docker Compose**: If you need to orchestrate multi-container applications, Docker Compose is a useful tool. Ensure it's installed and configured properly. If after installation you have trouble using it, ensure that you might need to rename the downloaded Docker Compose binary to `docker-compose` for easy access. Here's how you can rename it:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   mv docker-compose-linux-x86_64 docker-compose\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This resolves issues where the command may not be recognized. [Find more about Docker Compose here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/046_e43abaa421_docker-docker-compose-still-not-available-after-ch.md).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Starting Docker**: Make sure that the Docker service is running. You can start Docker with:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   sudo systemctl start docker\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you should be able to effectively use Docker on a Linux system. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask!\n"

Instead of relying on a single consumer to handle all the data, you can deploy additional consumer instances, thereby effectively managing higher volumes of data and ensuring that the system can scale out as needed.\n",

      "To unzip a Parquet file and use it with pandas, you generally do not need to unzip a Parquet file because Parquet is a columnar storage file format that pandas can read directly. However, if you are working with a compressed file (like `.gz`), you would handle it slightly differently. Here’s how you can work with Parquet files using pandas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. If you have a `.parquet` file directly, you can read it using:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import pandas as pd\n",
      "   \n",
      "   df = pd.read_parquet('your_file.parquet')\n",

      "2. If you have a compressed `.csv.gz` file that you want to convert to a DataFrame:\n",
      "   - First, you would unzip it:\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     gunzip your_file.csv.gz\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Then, you can read the resulting CSV file:\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to download a Parquet file and work with it directly, you can do this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import os\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step to define the parquet file name\n",

      "df = pd.read_parquet(parquet_name)\n",
      "```\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Define Dates as Strings**: When creating an external table in BigQuery, define the `pickup_datetime` and `dropoff_datetime` fields as `STRING`. This will avoid any parsing errors related to date types during the initial upload:\n",

      "       uris = ['gs://bucket/*.csv']\n",
      "   );\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Convert to Timestamp**: Later, when creating models (for example, in dbt), you can convert these string fields to `TIMESTAMP` using the following SQL syntax:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```sql\n",
      "   SELECT \n",
      "       TIMESTAMP(CAST(fhv_tripdata.pickup_datetime AS STRING)) AS pickup_datetime,\n",

      "       {{ ref('stg_fhv_tripdata') }}\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "This method allows you to handle the date type errors more gracefully during the upload process and provides a way to ensure the data is in the correct format for further processing [source](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-4/075_8c9b0fdaa5_invalid-date-types-after-ingesting-fhv-data-throug.md).\n",

      "What can cause a `FileNotFoundException` when writing parquet files in PySpark, and how can I solve this?\n",
      "A `FileNotFoundException` when writing Parquet files in PySpark can occur due to several reasons. One common cause is related to the way Spark handles file paths and operations on them, especially in the context of lazy evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issue:**\n",
      "When you attempt to write to a Parquet file with mode set to \"overwrite,\" Spark may delete the existing files it is trying to read because of the lazy transformations it employs. Thus, you may encounter an error if Spark tries to read a file that has just been deleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example of the Error:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Code executed:\n",
      "df = spark.read.parquet(pq_path)\n",
      "\n",

      "# java.io.FileNotFoundException: File file:/path/to/your.data.parquet does not exist\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Solution:**\n",
      "1. **Write to a different directory:** Instead of writing to the same path where you read the Parquet files, you can specify a temporary or different directory for your output.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   df.write.parquet(pq_path_temp, mode=\"overwrite\")\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "By writing to a different path, you avoid the conflict of trying to read and overwrite the same file simultaneously, which eliminates the `FileNotFoundException` error.\n",

      "In PySpark, the difference between two `TimestampType` values is converted into Python's native `datetime.timedelta` object. This object represents the duration in terms of days, seconds, and microseconds. To express this duration in hours, you need to manually convert it, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using `timedelta`:** After obtaining the timedelta object, you can access its total seconds using the `total_seconds()` method and then convert that to hours by dividing by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   duration_in_hours = (timestamp2 - timestamp1).total_seconds() / 3600\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Using the `datediff` SQL function:** This function returns the difference in days between two dates. You can multiply the result by 24 to get the duration in hours:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```sql\n",
      "   SELECT DATEDIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime) * 24 AS duration_in_hours\n",
      "   ```\n",
