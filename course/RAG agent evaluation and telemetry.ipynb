      "2. **Update WSL2**: If you encounter the error \"WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x800701bc\", make sure to update the WSL2 Linux Kernel by following guidelines provided at this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5393).\n",

      "### Common Troubleshooting:\n",
      "- **Elevated Privileges**: If you run into an error about needing elevated privileges, make sure you are running the Docker client with administrative permissions.\n",
      "- **Initial Setup**: Make sure you have the latest version of Docker installed. If Docker seems stuck or does not start, uninstalling and reinstalling might help.\n",

      "To use Docker on Linux, you may need to follow these general steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Installation**: Depending on your Linux distribution, you can install Docker using different methods. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the snap command:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   sudo snap install docker\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This command installs Docker via snap packages, which might be available on certain versions of Ubuntu. [Learn more here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/036_1b727dde32_docker-docker-not-installable-on-ubuntu.md).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Extra Hosts Configuration**: If you're using Docker Compose and face issues resolving `host.docker.internal`, you might need to configure it in your `docker-compose.yml` file like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```yaml\n",
      "   kestra:\n",
      "     image: kestra/kestra:latest\n",
      "     extra_hosts:\n",
      "       - \"host.docker.internal:host-gateway\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This setup allows your container to access host services correctly. You can check more details on this configuration. [Read more here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-2/015_48b99a69ff_fix-add-extra_hosts-for-hostdockerinternal-on-linu.md).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Using Docker Commands**: After installing Docker, you can start using Docker commands in the terminal. Common commands include:\n",
      "   - `docker run`: To run a container.\n",
      "   - `docker ps`: To list running containers.\n",
      "   - `docker images`: To list available images.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Docker Compose**: If you need to orchestrate multi-container applications, Docker Compose is a useful tool. Ensure it's installed and configured properly. If after installation you have trouble using it, ensure that you might need to rename the downloaded Docker Compose binary to `docker-compose` for easy access. Here's how you can rename it:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   mv docker-compose-linux-x86_64 docker-compose\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This resolves issues where the command may not be recognized. [Find more about Docker Compose here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/046_e43abaa421_docker-docker-compose-still-not-available-after-ch.md).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Starting Docker**: Make sure that the Docker service is running. You can start Docker with:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   sudo systemctl start docker\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you should be able to effectively use Docker on a Linux system. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask!\n"
