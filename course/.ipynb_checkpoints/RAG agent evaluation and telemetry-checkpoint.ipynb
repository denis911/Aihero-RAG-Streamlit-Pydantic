      "Using Docker on Windows can vary depending on whether you're using Windows 10 or Windows 11, as well as whether you have the Home or Pro edition. Here are the general steps to get started:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Docker Desktop**: \n",
      "   - Download and install Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).\n",
      "   - Make sure you are running the latest version.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enable Hyper-V or WSL2**:\n",
      "   - **Windows 10 Pro / 11 Pro Users**:\n",
      "     - Ensure Hyper-V is enabled, which Docker can use as a backend. You can find instructions in this [Hyper-V Enablement Guide](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/install-and-configured-docker-desktop-in-windows-10/).\n",
      "   - **Windows 10 Home / 11 Home Users**:\n",
      "     - Since Hyper-V isn't supported, use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). Check this [WSL Install Guide](https://pureinfotech.com/install-wsl-windows-11/) for detailed instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Run Docker with Elevated Privileges**:\n",
      "   - If you encounter connection errors, make sure to run the Docker client with elevated privileges (as an administrator).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Troubleshooting**:\n",
      "   - If Docker won't start or is stuck, try switching the containers from Windows to Linux or vice versa by right-clicking the Docker symbol from the running programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Using Docker Commands**:\n",
      "   - You can run Docker commands in your terminal or command prompt. For example, to run a basic Python container, you can use:\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     docker run -it python:3.9\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "For more details on specific error messages and how to handle them, you can refer to the relevant sections in the course documentation. Here's one specific reference for handling connection errors: [error during connect](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/011_46dbe4810d_docker-error-during-connect-in-the-default-daemon.md).\n",
