Without proper evaluation, you can't tell if your changes improve or hurt performance. You can't compare different approaches. And you can't build confidence before deploying to users.\n"

      "To use Docker on Linux, follow these general steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Docker:**\n",
      "   To install Docker on your Linux distribution, you can typically use the package manager specific to your system. Here are basic commands for common distributions:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Ubuntu:**\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     sudo apt update\n",
      "     sudo apt install docker.io\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **CentOS:**\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     sudo yum install docker\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Fedora:**\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     sudo dnf install docker\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Start Docker Service:**\n",
      "   After installation, you need to start the Docker service:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   sudo systemctl start docker\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enable Docker to Start at Boot:**\n",
      "   To ensure Docker starts automatically when your system boots, use:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   sudo systemctl enable docker\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Your User to the Docker Group:**\n",
      "   To run Docker commands without `sudo`, add your user to the Docker group:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   After running this command, log out and back in for this change to take effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Run Docker Commands:**\n",
      "   You can now start using Docker. For example, to check that Docker is installed correctly:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker --version\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Running a Container:**\n",
      "   To run a simple container (like an Ubuntu container), use:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker run -it ubuntu bash\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Stopping a Container:**\n",
      "   If you need to stop a running container, you can use:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker stop <container_id>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Using Docker Compose:**\n",
      "   If you want to use Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications, you may need to install it separately. You can download it using:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n",
      "   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Extra Hosts for Linux:**\n",
      "   If you are using a configuration that requires the `host.docker.internal`, you may need to add an entry to your Docker Compose file:\n",
      "   ```yaml\n",
      "   extra_hosts:\n",
      "     - \"host.docker.internal:host-gateway\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
