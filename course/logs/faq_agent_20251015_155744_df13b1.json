For inter-container communication within the same network, it is recommended to use the service name directly.",

This method is generally reliable and avoids issues related to licensing changes.\n\n2. **Using Homebrew:**\n   - Be aware that there can be conflicts when installing with Homebrew, especially between Docker Desktop and command-line tools. To avoid issues:\n     \n     - Install Docker Desktop first.\n     - Then install the command line tools.\n\n   - Commands:\n     \n     ```bash\n     brew install --cask docker\n     ```\n     \n     ```bash\n     brew install docker docker-compose\n     ```\n\n   - For more detailed issues related to `brew install`, refer to this [Issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/16309). \n\nFor more details, you can check the article on [Setting up Docker in macOS](https://medium.com/@vivekslair/setting-up-docker-in-macos-ee36d37b3be2).",

          "content": "To use Docker on Linux, follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Install Docker:**\n   To install Docker on your Linux distribution, you can typically use the package manager specific to your system. Here are basic commands for common distributions:\n\n   - **Ubuntu:**\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt update\n     sudo apt install docker.io\n     ```\n   - **CentOS:**\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum install docker\n     ```\n   - **Fedora:**\n     ```bash\n     sudo dnf install docker\n     ```\n\n2. **Start Docker Service:**\n   After installation, you need to start the Docker service:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl start docker\n   ```\n\n3. **Enable Docker to Start at Boot:**\n   To ensure Docker starts automatically when your system boots, use:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl enable docker\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Your User to the Docker Group:**\n   To run Docker commands without `sudo`, add your user to the Docker group:\n   ```bash\n   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n   ```\n   After running this command, log out and back in for this change to take effect.\n\n5. **Run Docker Commands:**\n   You can now start using Docker. For example, to check that Docker is installed correctly:\n   ```bash\n   docker --version\n   ```\n\n6. **Running a Container:**\n   To run a simple container (like an Ubuntu container), use:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -it ubuntu bash\n   ```\n\n7. **Stopping a Container:**\n   If you need to stop a running container, you can use:\n   ```bash\n   docker stop <container_id>\n   ```\n\n8. **Using Docker Compose:**\n   If you want to use Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications, you may need to install it separately. You can download it using:\n   ```bash\n   sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n   ```\n\n9. **Extra Hosts for Linux:**\n   If you are using a configuration that requires the `host.docker.internal`, you may need to add an entry to your Docker Compose file:\n   ```yaml\n   extra_hosts:\n     - \"host.docker.internal:host-gateway\"\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install and start using Docker on your Linux system.
