You need to ensure that Hyper-V is enabled on your system. You can follow a tutorial to enable Hyper-V on Windows 10/11, such as [this one](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/install-and-configured-docker-desktop-in-windows-10/).\n2. **Install Docker Desktop**: Download Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) and install it.\n3. **Running Docker**: After installation, run Docker Desktop.\n\n### For Windows 10 Home / 11 Home Users:\n1. **Use WSL2**: The 'Home' version does not support Hyper-V, so you need to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). Follow the instructions to [install WSL on Windows 11](https://pureinfotech.com/install-wsl-windows-11/).\n2. **Install Docker Desktop**: Download Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) and during the installation, ensure that the WSL2 backend is selected.\n\n### Troubleshooting:\n- If you encounter an error like `docker: error during connect: In the default daemon configuration on Windows...`, it may be due to insufficient privileges. Ensure you are running the Docker client with elevated privileges (Run as Administrator).\n- If Docker is stuck on starting, you can try switching between Windows and Linux containers by right-clicking the Docker symbol in the system tray.\n\n### Keeping Docker Updated:\nMake sure you are using the latest version of Docker. You can download the latest version from the [Docker's official site](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). If you're having issues with the upgrade, uninstall and reinstall Docker.\n\nFor more details, refer to your specific version's documentation or check Docker's official [installation guide for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).",
