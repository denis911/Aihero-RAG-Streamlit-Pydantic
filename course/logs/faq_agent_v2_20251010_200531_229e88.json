To avoid issues:\n     \n     - Install Docker Desktop first.\n     - Then install the command line tools.\n\n   - Commands:\n     \n     ```bash\n     brew install --cask docker\n     ```\n     \n     ```bash\n     brew install docker docker-compose\n     ```\n\n   - For more detailed issues related to `brew install`, refer to this [Issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/16309). \n\nFor more details, you can check the article on [Setting up Docker in macOS](https://medium.com/@vivekslair/setting-up-docker-in-macos-ee36d37b3be2).",

Here are the general steps to get started:\n\n1. **Install Docker Desktop**: \n   - Download and install Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).\n   - Make sure you are running the latest version.\n\n2. **Enable Hyper-V or WSL2**:\n   - **Windows 10 Pro / 11 Pro Users**:\n     - Ensure Hyper-V is enabled, which Docker can use as a backend. You can find instructions in this [Hyper-V Enablement Guide](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/install-and-configured-docker-desktop-in-windows-10/).\n   - **Windows 10 Home / 11 Home Users**:\n     - Since Hyper-V isn't supported, use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). Check this [WSL Install Guide](https://pureinfotech.com/install-wsl-windows-11/) for detailed instructions.\n\n3. **Run Docker with Elevated Privileges**:\n   - If you encounter connection errors, make sure to run the Docker client with elevated privileges (as an administrator).\n\n4. **Troubleshooting**:\n   - If Docker won't start or is stuck, try switching the containers from Windows to Linux or vice versa by right-clicking the Docker symbol from the running programs.\n\n5. **Using Docker Commands**:\n   - You can run Docker commands in your terminal or command prompt. For example, to run a basic Python container, you can use:\n     ```bash\n     docker run -it python:3.9\n     ```\n\nFor more details on specific error messages and how to handle them, you can refer to the relevant sections in the course documentation.
